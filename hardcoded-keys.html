<h2>1. Overview</h2>
Hardcoded keys and secrets refer to credentials, API keys, cryptographic keys, tokens, or passwords embedded directly in source code, binaries, or configuration files. 
These can be extracted by attackers, compromising the security of applications, services, or sensitive data.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>2. Common Causes</h2>

<b>2.1 Embedded Secrets in Source Code</b>
- API keys, passwords, encryption keys written directly in code.  
- Often committed to version control (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).  

<b>2.2 Configuration Files</b>
- Secrets stored in plaintext config files shipped with applications.  

<b>2.3 Compiled Binaries / Mobile Apps</b>
- Keys embedded in executables, libraries, or mobile apps.  
- Reverse engineering can reveal them.  

<b>2.4 Third-Party Libraries / SDKs</b>
- Libraries containing their own hardcoded keys or tokens.  
- Developers may inadvertently include them.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>3. Attacker Perspective</h2>
- Extract keys from public repositories, code, or binaries.  
- Access sensitive resources without authorization (databases, APIs, cloud services).  
- Decrypt data encrypted with hardcoded secrets.  
- Use the same key across environments to escalate privileges.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>4. Defender Perspective</h2>
- Hardcoded secrets are a single point of failure.  
- They are difficult to rotate without redeploying applications.  
- Exposure may result in widespread compromise.  
- Violates compliance requirements for secure secret management.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>5. Examples</h2>

<b>Example 1: API Key in Source Code</b>
<code>const API_KEY = "12345abcdef";</code>
- Anyone inspecting the code can access the service with full privileges.

<b>Example 2: Database Credentials in Configuration</b>
<code>
db_user = "admin"
db_pass = "P@ssw0rd123"
</code>
- If leaked, attacker can connect directly to the database.

<b>Example 3: Hardcoded Encryption Key</b>
<code>
const ENCRYPTION_KEY = "abcdef1234567890";
</code>
- All encrypted user data can be decrypted if the key is discovered.

<b>Example 4: Embedded OAuth Token</b>
<code>
const ACCESS_TOKEN = "ya29.A0ARrdaM...xyz";
</code>
- Enables full API access without user consent or authentication.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>6. Best Practices / Mitigation</h2>

<b>6.1 Avoid Hardcoding Secrets</b>
- Never store keys, passwords, or tokens directly in code.  

<b>6.2 Use Secure Secret Management</b>
- Environment variables for runtime injection.  
- Dedicated secret management systems (HashiCorp Vault, AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault).  
- Encrypted configuration files with restricted access.

<b>6.3 Rotate Keys Regularly</b>
- Replace keys periodically or immediately if compromised.  

<b>6.4 Limit Scope and Permissions</b>
- Apply least privilege principle to all keys and secrets.  
- Avoid using same keys across environments or services.

<b>6.5 Monitor for Leaks</b>
- Scan source code and repositories for secrets (GitLeaks, TruffleHog).  
- Audit binaries, containers, and mobile apps for embedded secrets.

<h2>7. Summary</h2>
Hardcoded keys and secrets are critical security vulnerabilities.  
They can be easily extracted, giving attackers unauthorized access to sensitive resources.  
Using secure secret management, proper access controls, key rotation, and regular audits are essential to mitigate this risk.
