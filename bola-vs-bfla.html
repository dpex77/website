<h2>1. Overview:</h2>
BOLA (Broken Object Level Access Control) and BFLA (Broken Function Level Access Control) are both access control vulnerabilities, but they target different aspects of an application:

- <b>BOLA:</b> Unauthorized access to objects or resources belonging to other users.  
- <b>BFLA:</b> Unauthorized access to functions, actions, or features intended for higher-privileged users.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>2. Vulnerability from an Attacker Perspective:</h2>
<b>BOLA:</b>  
Attackers target object-level permissions. By manipulating identifiers like IDs, UUIDs, filenames, or database keys, they can access other users’ sensitive data.  

<b>Example:</b>  
<code>
# User A accesses their profile
GET /api/user/1234/profile

# Attacker changes the ID to view another user’s profile
GET /api/user/5678/profile
</code>  

Impact: Data exposure, privacy violation, potential regulatory compliance issues.

<b>BFLA:</b>  
Attackers target function or action-level permissions. By calling endpoints or triggering actions restricted to admins or premium users, they can perform unauthorized operations.  

<b>Example:</b>  
<code>
# Normal user tries to delete another user
POST /api/admin/deleteUser

# Or access privileged feature
GET /upload   # Only admins should access
</code>  

Impact: System manipulation, privilege abuse, unauthorized feature use.

<div class="card">
<h2>2.1 Attacker Attempts:</h2>
<b>BOLA:</b>
- Enumerate object identifiers (sequential IDs, predictable UUIDs).  
- Manipulate request parameters (query string, JSON payload, form data) to access unauthorized objects.  
- Exploit weak authorization checks at object level.  

<b>BFLA:</b>
- Attempt unauthorized HTTP requests to admin or restricted endpoints.  
- Exploit insufficient role-based access control (RBAC).  
- Use replayed or forged requests to access restricted functionality.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>3. Vulnerability from a Defender Perspective:</h2>
<b>BOLA:</b>
- Developers often fail to validate that the requesting user owns or is authorized for a specific object.  
- Object-level authorization checks may be missing or incorrectly implemented.  

<b>BFLA:</b>
- Application exposes functionality without checking user roles or privileges.  
- Endpoints may assume client-side or superficial server-side checks are enough.  
- Role escalation attacks become possible.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>3.1 Solutions for a Defender:</h2>
<b>BOLA Mitigations:</b>  
- Implement strict object-level authorization on every request.  
- Use secure, unpredictable object identifiers (UUIDs or opaque tokens).  
- Validate ownership or access rights on server side before returning data.  
- Regularly test endpoints for IDOR vulnerabilities.

<b>BFLA Mitigations:</b>  
- Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) for all actions and features.  
- Verify authorization on server-side for each function, regardless of client trust.  
- Implement principle of least privilege: users can only perform actions they need.  
- Audit and log privileged function access.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>4. Extras:</h2>
- <b>BOLA Question:</b> “Can I access someone else’s object?” → Resource-level access issue.  
- <b>BFLA Question:</b> “Can I perform a function I shouldn’t?” → Action/feature-level access issue.  
- Both are part of OWASP’s Broken Access Control category.  
- Attackers often chain BOLA and BFLA with other vulnerabilities (like injection or session hijacking) for maximum impact.
