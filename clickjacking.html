<h2>1. Overview:</h2>
Clickjacking is a vulnerability where an attacker tricks a user into clicking on something different from what the user perceives, potentially revealing confidential information or allowing unintended actions. It usually involves embedding a website or interface in a transparent or opaque iframe.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>2. Vulnerability from an Attacker Perspective:</h2>
Attackers can exploit clickjacking to:  

- Hijack clicks intended for legitimate interface elements.  
- Trigger actions like fund transfers, password changes, or account deletion.  
- Steal sensitive information or perform actions on behalf of the user without consent.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>2.1 Attempts of an Attacker:</h2>
- Overlaying a transparent iframe over a trusted website’s button.  
- Luring the user to a malicious page with disguised controls.  
- Using social engineering to convince the user to interact with hidden elements.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>3. Vulnerability from a Defender Perspective:</h2>
- Allowing the website to be embedded in iframes without restriction.  
- Lack of frame-busting or anti-clickjacking headers.  
- No validation of the source of requests or user interactions.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>3.1 Solutions of a Defender:</h2>
<b>Use X-Frame-Options Header:</b>  
- <code>X-Frame-Options: DENY</code> → prevents all framing.  
- <code>X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN</code> → allows framing only from the same origin.

<b>Content Security Policy (CSP) Frame-Ancestors Directive:</b>  
- Example: <code>Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self'</code>  
- Defines which origins can embed the content in frames.

<b>UI Hardening:</b>  
- Avoid placing critical clickable elements at predictable positions that could be targeted by clickjacking.  
- Confirm sensitive actions through secondary prompts or CAPTCHAs.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>4. Extras:</h2>
- Clickjacking can be combined with other attacks like CSRF for more impactful exploits.  
- Always test your web application by trying to embed it in a malicious iframe during security assessments.  
- Keep headers and UI validation up to date for robust defense.
