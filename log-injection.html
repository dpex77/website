<h2>1. Overview:</h2>
Log Injection is a type of security vulnerability where an attacker manipulates the log files of an application to:

- Insert malicious entries  
- Obfuscate their actions  
- Inject false information  
- Break log parsing or analysis tools
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>2. Vulnerability from an Attacker Perspective:</h2>
Attackers can exploit logs that are writable by them or logs that store unvalidated input. By doing so, they can:

- Hide their activities  
- Inject misleading entries  
- Trigger downstream tools or scripts to misbehave
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>2.1 Attempts of an Attacker:</h2>
Example scenarios:

- Sending newline characters to split log entries  
- Including malicious strings to confuse parsing scripts  
- Injecting code that may be executed by log analyzers or alerting tools
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>3. Vulnerability from a Defender Perspective:</h2>
- Always sanitize user input before logging (e.g., escape newline characters).  
- Use strict file permissions (e.g., chmod 640) so only the app/user can write.  
- Monitor logs for unusual entries.  
- Prefer append-only or immutable logging mechanisms to prevent tampering.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>3.1 Solutions for a Defender:</h2>
- Sanitize all loggable input to escape special characters.  
- Limit log write access to only necessary processes/users.  
- Implement logging frameworks that automatically handle safe logging.  
- Regularly audit logs and implement alerting on suspicious patterns.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>4. Extras:</h2>
- Log Injection doesnâ€™t directly compromise the system but can hide malicious activity.  
- Can impact forensic analysis, alerting, or automated monitoring tools.  
- Immutable logging (write-once storage) is one of the most robust mitigations.
