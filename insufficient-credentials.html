<h2>1. Overview:</h2>
Insufficiently protected credentials occur when passwords, keys, or sensitive authentication secrets are stored or transmitted insecurely.  
Examples include plain text storage, weak or fast hashing algorithms (MD5, SHA-1), missing salting/peppering, or private keys without passphrase protection.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>2. Vulnerability from an Attacker Perspective:</h2>
Attackers can exploit poorly protected credentials to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or compromise multiple accounts.  

<b>1. Password Attacks:</b>  
- Brute-force: Trying billions of password combinations per second using GPU/ASIC acceleration.  
- Dictionary attacks: Using common passwords or leaked password lists.  
- Rainbow table attacks: Precomputed hash tables allow fast lookup of hashed passwords if salts are absent.

<b>2. Token/Key Theft:</b>  
- Private keys without passphrases can be used immediately if stolen.  
- API keys or session secrets stored in plaintext are trivial to exploit.

<b>3. Exploiting Weak Hash Functions:</b>  
- MD5 and SHA-1 are fast → attacker can try billions of guesses per second.  
- Collisions may allow attackers to bypass integrity checks or authentication.  

<b>4. Salts and Peppers:</b>  
- Lack of salt: Identical passwords produce the same hash → attackers can use precomputed tables.  
- Lack of pepper: If database leaks, attackers can brute-force hashes more easily.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>2.1 Attempts of an Attacker:</h2>
- Access a leaked database or backup containing user hashes.  
- Use tools like Hashcat, John the Ripper to brute-force or dictionary attack weak hashes.  
- Exploit fast hashes (SHA-256 without salt) to crack passwords rapidly.  
- Attempt offline attacks using rainbow tables if no salts are present.  
- If private keys are unprotected, use them to authenticate as the user without password.  
- Combine credential reuse attacks across other services using stolen passwords.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>3. Vulnerability from a Defender Perspective:</h2>
Defenders need to recognize that storing credentials insecurely exposes users and systems to compromise.  

Key risks:  
- Plaintext passwords or keys.  
- Fast hashing algorithms (SHA-256/512) without computational delay.  
- Missing salt or pepper.  
- Weak password policies.  
- Storing secrets in code or logs.  
- Lack of proper key/passphrase protection for private keys.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>3.1 Solutions for a Defender:</h2>
<b>Password Hashing:</b>  
- Use modern password hashing algorithms: bcrypt (CPU-hard), scrypt or Argon2 (memory-hard).  
- Apply a unique salt per user to prevent identical hash values.  
- Use a pepper (stored separately) for extra security.  

<b>Private Keys:</b>  
- Protect with strong passphrase.  
- Use hardware security modules (HSMs) or secure vaults.  

<b>General Credential Management:</b>  
- Never store passwords or secrets in plaintext.  
- Avoid embedding secrets in code or logs.  
- Enforce strong password policies and MFA.  
- Rotate credentials periodically.  

<b>Implementation Example:</b>
<code>
import bcrypt

password = b"supersecret"
salt = bcrypt.gensalt()
hashed = bcrypt.hashpw(password, salt)
</code>

- Verifying:  
<code>
bcrypt.checkpw(password, hashed)  # Returns True if match
</code>

- Offline attacks become impractical due to computational cost of bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>4. Extras:</h2>
- Difference between fast hashes (SHA-256) and slow hashes (bcrypt, Argon2): slow hashes drastically reduce offline brute-force efficiency.  
- Pepper vs salt: salt is public, pepper is secret. Combining both increases security.  
- Monitoring: Detect abnormal login attempts or mass authentication failures.  
- User education: Encourage unique passwords and MFA to reduce damage if hashes are compromised.
