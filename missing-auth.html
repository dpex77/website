<h2>1. Overview:</h2>
Missing Authentication for Critical Functions occurs when important actions in an application or system can be executed without verifying the identity of the user.  
This exposes high-impact functionality to anyone, including unauthenticated attackers, potentially compromising security, integrity, or availability.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>2. Vulnerability from an Attacker Perspective:</h2>
From an attacker’s perspective, missing authentication provides direct access to critical operations without restriction.  

<b>Examples of Exploitable Actions:</b>  
- System upgrade or software patch deployment  
- Configuration changes or server settings  
- Account deletion or creation  
- System shutdown or restart  
- Modifying sensitive data (financial, personal, or operational)  

<b>High-value Impact:</b>  
- Full system compromise  
- Unauthorized data modification or deletion  
- Service disruption or downtime  
- Bypassing security controls meant for privileged users  
- Escalation opportunities when combined with other vulnerabilities
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>2.1 Attempts of an Attacker:</h2>
- Discover unprotected endpoints (GET, POST, DELETE) using fuzzing or browsing API documentation.  
- Attempt direct requests to critical functions without providing authentication tokens, sessions, or credentials.  
- Use tools like Burp Suite or curl to test access to endpoints that should be restricted.  
- Chain with other vulnerabilities (e.g., privilege escalation, injection) to maximize impact.  

<b>Example:</b>  
<code>
# Vulnerable endpoint:
POST /upgrade
# No authentication check in place

# Attacker can trigger upgrade directly:
curl -X POST http://target.com/upgrade
</code>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>3. Vulnerability from a Defender Perspective:</h2>
Defenders must ensure that all critical functions are protected and never accessible without proper authentication.  

<b>Common Mistakes:</b>  
- Assuming network-level controls are sufficient to restrict access.  
- Exposing APIs to internal or external users without token/session validation.  
- Lack of role-based access control (RBAC).  
- Insufficient logging of sensitive operations.  
- Relying solely on client-side validation (JavaScript checks).
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>3.1 Solutions for a Defender:</h2>
<b>1. Enforce Authentication:</b>  
- Require login, API tokens, or session verification before executing critical functions.  

<b>2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):</b>  
- Assign roles and permissions to restrict which users can perform sensitive actions.  

<b>3. Validate Access Tokens:</b>  
- Check validity of sessions, JWTs, or API keys on every request.  

<b>4. Logging and Auditing:</b>  
- Record all access attempts to critical functions, successful or failed, for monitoring and incident response.  

<b>5. Security Testing:</b>  
- Include missing authentication tests in your security assessment and penetration testing.  
- Use automated scanners to detect unprotected endpoints.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>4. Extras:</h2>
- Even internal endpoints should enforce authentication; internal networks are not inherently trustworthy.  
- Combine with strong authorization checks to prevent privilege abuse.  
- Always assume an attacker can reach endpoints and enforce authentication and authorization consistently.  
- OWASP Top 10: This vulnerability falls under “Broken Access Control” (A01:2021).
