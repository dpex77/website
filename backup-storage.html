<h2>1. Overview</h2>
Misconfigured Backup or Storage occurs when backup systems, cloud storage, or local storage are improperly configured, leaving sensitive data exposed, inaccessible, or at risk of loss.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>2. Common Issues</h2>

<b>2.1 Unencrypted Backups</b>
- Backups stored without encryption at rest or in transit.  
- Risk: Data theft if backups are stolen or intercepted.

<b>2.2 Publicly Accessible Storage</b>
- Misconfigured S3 buckets, Azure Blob containers, or NAS drives accessible to everyone.  
- Risk: Data exposure or accidental deletion.

<b>2.3 No Access Controls</b>
- Backups lack proper IAM/ACL policies.  
- Risk: Unauthorized users can read, modify, or delete backups.

<b>2.4 Retention Mismanagement</b>
- Backups not rotated or old backups not pruned.  
- Risk: Excessive storage cost, non-compliance, or old sensitive data exposure.

<b>2.5 Incomplete or Corrupt Backups</b>
- Backups missing files, databases, or metadata; corrupted during creation.  
- Risk: Inability to restore critical data when needed.

<b>2.6 Lack of Testing</b>
- Backups created but not regularly tested for restore.  
- Risk: Backup failure discovered only during disaster recovery.

<h2>3. Real-World Examples</h2>

<b>Example 1: Public S3 Buckets</b>
- Sensitive customer data left in S3 buckets with open read permissions.  
- Consequence: Data breach and regulatory fines.

<b>Example 2: Unencrypted Database Backups</b>
- PostgreSQL backups stored on file server without encryption.  
- Consequence: Insider threat or stolen device exposes sensitive information.

<b>Example 3: Ransomware Recovery Failure</b>
- Backups not tested or incomplete.  
- Consequence: Ransomware attack cannot be mitigated, leading to downtime and data loss.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>4. Best Practices / Mitigations</h2>

<b>4.1 Encrypt Backups</b>
- Use strong encryption (AES-256) for backups at rest and in transit.  
- Protect encryption keys in a secure KMS or vault.

<b>4.2 Proper Access Controls</b>
- Implement role-based access, least privilege, and IAM policies.  
- Restrict who can create, read, or delete backups.

<b>4.3 Backup Testing</b>
- Regularly perform restore drills to ensure data integrity and completeness.  
- Verify both full and incremental backups.

<b>4.4 Secure Cloud Storage</b>
- Check S3/Azure/GCP bucket permissions regularly.  
- Enable logging, monitoring, and alerts for public access or modifications.

<b>4.5 Retention and Rotation Policies</b>
- Maintain backup retention aligned with compliance (e.g., 30, 90, 180 days).  
- Remove or archive old backups securely.

<b>4.6 Monitoring and Auditing</b>
- Enable logging of backup creation, modification, and deletion.  
- Audit backup policies periodically to ensure compliance and security.

<h2>5. Summary</h2>
Misconfigured backup or storage can lead to data breaches, non-compliance, and unrecoverable data loss.  
Implement encryption, access control, rotation, and regular restore testing to mitigate risks.
