<h2>1. Overview</h2>
Missing Version Control for Configurations occurs when configuration files for servers, applications, or cloud resources are not tracked under version control.  
This can lead to inconsistent deployments, misconfigurations, and difficulties in auditing changes or rolling back problematic updates.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>2. Common Issues</h2>

<b>2.1 Untracked Config Files</b>
- Configurations stored locally on servers or in spreadsheets without a versioning system.  
- Risk: Accidental overwrites, inconsistencies across environments, or lost changes.

<b>2.2 Lack of Change History</b>
- No record of who changed what and when.  
- Risk: Hard to debug issues or investigate security incidents.

<b>2.3 Inconsistent Environments</b>
- Different versions of configs in dev, staging, and production.  
- Risk: Bugs or security issues appear only in some environments.

<b>2.4 No Rollback Capability</b>
- If a configuration change breaks functionality, reverting is manual or error-prone.  
- Risk: Extended downtime, security misconfigurations.

<b>2.5 Unauthorized Changes</b>
- Without version control, it's difficult to enforce change approval processes.  
- Risk: Unauthorized or malicious modifications may go unnoticed.

<h2>3. Real-World Examples</h2>

<b>Example 1: Web Server Misconfiguration</b>
- Apache configuration updated on production server manually without tracking.  
- Consequence: Inconsistent SSL settings across servers, some still vulnerable.

<b>Example 2: Cloud Infrastructure Drift</b>
- AWS CloudFormation templates manually modified in production without versioning.  
- Consequence: Terraform or IaC deployments fail, security policies not enforced.

<b>Example 3: Application Config Drift</b>
- App settings stored in JSON/YAML locally, not in Git.  
- Consequence: Developer mistakes overwrite database connection settings in production.

<h2>4. Best Practices / Mitigations</h2>

<b>4.1 Use Version Control Systems</b>
- Track all configuration files in Git or other VCS.  
- Maintain history, commit messages, and authorship.

<b>4.2 Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</b>
- Store cloud resource configurations (Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible) in version control.  
- Ensure all environments are provisioned consistently.

<b>4.3 Code Review and Approval</b>
- Require peer review for config changes.  
- Integrate CI/CD pipelines to validate changes before deployment.

<b>4.4 Automated Deployment</b>
- Use scripts or IaC pipelines to apply changes rather than manual edits.  
- Reduces human error and ensures consistent versions across environments.

<b>4.5 Audit and Monitoring</b>
- Periodically review configuration change history.  
- Detect unauthorized or untracked modifications.

<h2>5. Summary</h2>
Missing version control for configurations increases the risk of misconfigurations, inconsistent environments, and security incidents.  
Implementing version control, IaC practices, and change management ensures traceability, rollback capability, and safer deployments.
