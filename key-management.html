<h2>1. Overview</h2>
Improper key management occurs when cryptographic keys, secrets, or credentials are generated, stored, rotated, or revoked insecurely.  
In AWS, this can lead to unauthorized access to services, data leaks, or full account compromise.

<h2>2. Common AWS Key Management Mistakes</h2>

<b>2.1 Hardcoded Keys in Code</b>
- Access keys and secrets stored in source code or config files.  
- Risk: Anyone with code access can use your AWS resources.  

<b>2.2 Unencrypted Keys</b>
- Keys or secrets stored in plaintext in S3, EC2, or environment variables.  
- Risk: Exposure if storage is misconfigured or compromised.  

<b>2.3 Lack of Rotation</b>
- Keys never rotated or rotated infrequently.  
- Risk: Stolen or leaked keys remain valid indefinitely.  

<b>2.4 Excessive Permissions</b>
- Keys or IAM roles have overly broad privileges (e.g., AdministratorAccess when not required).  
- Risk: Compromise of key â†’ complete account takeover.  

<b>2.5 Poor Use of Temporary Credentials</b>
- Using long-lived keys instead of temporary tokens via AWS STS.  
- Risk: Long-lived credentials are easier to exfiltrate and misuse.

<h2>3. Examples / Real-World Scenarios</h2>

<b>Example 1: Hardcoded AWS Key</b>
<code>
aws_access_key = "AKIA...EXAMPLE"
aws_secret_key = "abcd1234EXAMPLE"
</code>
- Risk: If code is pushed to GitHub, attackers can immediately access AWS resources.  

<b>Example 2: S3 Bucket with Unencrypted Keys</b>
- Keys stored in a plaintext file in S3 (publicly readable).  
- Risk: Anyone with link can download keys and compromise AWS account.  

<b>Example 3: Long-lived IAM User Keys</b>
- IAM user keys never rotated.  
- Risk: If compromised, keys can be used indefinitely until manually revoked.  

<b>Example 4: Excessive Permissions</b>
- Keys tied to a user with full admin access.  
- Risk: Exploit leads to total AWS account compromise (EC2, S3, Lambda, etc.).

<h2>4. Best Practices / Mitigations in AWS</h2>

<b>4.1 Use IAM Roles and Temporary Credentials</b>
- Prefer IAM roles for EC2, Lambda, and ECS.  
- Use AWS STS (Security Token Service) for temporary credentials.  

<b>4.2 Avoid Hardcoding Secrets</b>
- Store secrets in AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store.  
- Grant least-privilege access to applications and users.  

<b>4.3 Enable Encryption</b>
- Use KMS-managed encryption for stored secrets.  
- Ensure secrets at rest and in transit are encrypted.  

<b>4.4 Rotate Keys Regularly</b>
- Configure automatic rotation in Secrets Manager.  
- Rotate IAM user access keys at least every 90 days.  

<b>4.5 Enforce Least Privilege</b>
- Grant only the permissions needed for a specific task.  
- Avoid using root account keys in applications.  

<b>4.6 Audit and Monitor</b>
- Enable AWS CloudTrail for logging key usage.  
- Set up CloudWatch alarms for unusual API activity.

<h2>5. Summary</h2>
Improper key management in AWS can lead to serious breaches, data leaks, and full account compromise.  
Best practice is to use roles, temporary credentials, encrypted storage, strict access control, and continuous monitoring.
