<h2>1. Overview:</h2>
Inadequate logout and session expiration occurs when applications do not properly terminate sessions or fail to expire them after a period of inactivity.  
This allows attackers to reuse sessions, even after the user believes they have logged out, leading to account compromise or unauthorized access.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>2. Vulnerability from an Attacker Perspective:</h2>
Attackers can exploit weak session termination or long-lived sessions to gain unauthorized access.  

<b>Attack Flow:</b>  
1. User logs into the application.  
2. User leaves the device unattended or logs out.  
3. Session ID remains valid on the server.  
4. Attacker reuses the session ID to access the account without credentials.  

This is especially dangerous on shared devices or when session tokens are predictable or insecurely stored.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>2.1 Attempts of an Attacker:</h2>
- Accessing session tokens stored in browser memory or cookies after logout.  
- Using stolen session tokens from a network sniffing attack (HTTP connections without Secure cookies).  
- Exploiting applications that do not invalidate old session IDs after logout or session timeout.  
- Reusing tokens on other devices or browser instances.  
- Observing session IDs in URL parameters and replaying them.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>3. Vulnerability from a Defender Perspective:</h2>
Defenders often fail to properly manage session lifecycle:

- Sessions persist after logout.  
- Session IDs are not regenerated after authentication.  
- Session timeout is too long or not enforced.  
- No absolute expiration (persistent sessions).  
- Browser back button can re-access sensitive pages after logout.  
- Tokens stored insecurely (localStorage, cookies without HttpOnly).
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>3.1 Solutions for a Defender:</h2>
- Invalidate session IDs immediately upon logout.  
- Regenerate session ID after login and sensitive actions.  
- Enforce session timeout after inactivity and absolute session expiration.  
- Implement "no cache" headers to prevent back-button access to sensitive pages:  
  <code>Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate</code>  
- Use Secure and HttpOnly cookies to store session IDs.  
- Limit session reuse and implement logout notification if possible.  
- Monitor for concurrent sessions and optionally notify users.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>4. Extras:</h2>
- Testing: Log in from one browser, log out, then attempt to access sensitive pages using back button or stored session ID.  
- Related vulnerabilities: Session Hijacking, Insecure Cookies, Session Fixation.  
- Business impact: Unauthorized access, account compromise, data breaches, regulatory non-compliance.  
- Tools for testing: Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, browser developer tools.
