<h2>1. Overview:</h2>
Insufficient Logging & Monitoring occurs when security-relevant events are either not logged, incompletely logged, or not actively monitored.  

This prevents early detection of attacks or misuse, allowing incidents to go unnoticed until damage is done.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>2. Vulnerability from an Attacker Perspective:</h2>
Attackers can exploit this weakness to:  
- Perform brute-force or credential stuffing attacks without detection  
- Escalate privileges or change roles undetected  
- Modify or delete resources without triggering alerts  
- Persist in systems for long periods while remaining invisible  
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>2.1 Examples for Understanding:</h2>

<b>Example 1: Missing Failed Login Logs</b>
- Attacker performs multiple failed login attempts  
- No log is generated → brute force goes undetected  

<b>Example 2: Privilege Escalation Unnoticed</b>
- Attacker escalates privileges using a misconfigured SUDO policy  
- No log or alert generated → attacker gains admin access silently  

<b>Example 3: Resource Modification Not Logged</b>
- Attacker deletes critical data  
- Logs exist but do not capture deletions or are scattered → incident only discovered later
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>3. Vulnerability from a Defender Perspective:</h2>
Causes of insufficient logging & monitoring:  
- Logging not implemented for critical actions  
- Inconsistent log formats across systems  
- No centralized collection or correlation of events  
- Lack of real-time monitoring or alerting  
- Logs not reviewed regularly  
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>3.1 Solutions for a Defender:</h2>
<b>Comprehensive Logging:</b>  
- Log authentication success/failure  
- Log privilege escalations and role changes  
- Log resource create/update/delete actions  
- Log administrative and security configuration changes  

<b>Centralized Log Management:</b>  
- Use SIEM/SOAR solutions (Splunk, ELK, Wazuh, Azure Sentinel)  
- Normalize log formats across applications, servers, and devices  
- Correlate events from multiple sources  

<b>Monitoring & Alerting:</b>  
- Implement real-time monitoring with IDS/IPS (Snort, Suricata)  
- Set alerts for suspicious behavior (multiple failed logins, unusual data access)  
- Review logs regularly for anomalies  

<b>Retention & Protection:</b>  
- Store logs securely with access controls and integrity checks  
- Retain logs according to compliance requirements (PCI DSS, HIPAA, etc.)  
- Regularly audit logs and alerting effectiveness
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>4. Extras:</h2>
- Insufficient logging is often combined with other vulnerabilities to increase impact.  
- Centralized logging and monitoring improves incident response and forensic capabilities.  
- Even if a system is compromised, effective logging can shorten detection time and reduce damage.
