<h2>1. Overview:</h2>
Insufficient Credential Hygiene refers to poor practices around password and authentication management that increase the risk of account compromise.  
This includes weak passwords, password reuse, default credentials, and improper storage of credentials.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>2. Vulnerability from an Attacker Perspective:</h2>
Attackers exploit weak credential hygiene to gain unauthorized access:  

<b>Weak Passwords:</b> Easily guessable (123456, password), allowing brute-force attacks.  

<b>Password Reuse:</b> Compromise of one account leads to compromise of other accounts using the same password.  

<b>Default Passwords:</b> Vendor or factory credentials left unchanged can be leveraged for easy access.  

<b>Insecure Password Storage:</b> Passwords stored in plaintext or weak hashes can be stolen in a breach, enabling credential reuse.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>2.1 Attacker Attempts:</h2>
- Brute-force login attempts using common passwords.  
- Credential stuffing using leaked passwords from other services.  
- Searching for default credentials in devices, applications, or IoT hardware.  
- Exploiting weak hash algorithms (MD5, SHA1) to crack passwords from a database dump.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>3. Vulnerability from a Defender Perspective:</h2>
- Lack of strong password policies.  
- Absence of multi-factor authentication (MFA).  
- Failure to hash and salt passwords before storing in the database.  
- Not disabling or changing default passwords on systems or applications.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>3.1 Solutions for a Defender:</h2>
- Enforce strong, unique passwords for every account (e.g., minimum length, complexity requirements).  
- Encourage or require use of password managers for secure password generation and storage.  
- Hash passwords securely using slow, modern algorithms (bcrypt, Argon2, scrypt) with unique salts.  
- Disable or immediately change all default credentials on devices, software, and services.  
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible.  
- Monitor for reused credentials or compromised passwords via threat intelligence feeds.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>4. Extras:</h2>
- Weak credential hygiene is a leading cause of account compromise in data breaches.  
- Even a single reused or weak password can lead to cascading compromises.  
- Training and awareness for users about proper password hygiene is essential.  
- Combine with session management and access control best practices to strengthen overall security posture.
